This is Watch Tuna, a web app that helps watch owners with no professional tools to tune their watches or at least determine how much their watches miss the actual time.
It uses microphone to record the soundwave of balance wheel, then seeks for peaks in the soundwave, calculates frequency of ticking as accurately as possible, then compares it to actual required frequency of a watch and calculates how many seconds per day will the watch lose or gain.

Additionally, I'm going to implement a possibility of creating an account and storing the info about your watches and accessing it from anywhere.
